# Points to be noted while working with JS Code
1. Use Native Fucntions provided by Object so that the custom code can be reduced
    - Instead of writing COMPLEX-LOGIC for Data Processing for Object (Collections) check for the standard function provided by the object that satisfies requirement  
    - E.g.
        - Array provides 'reduce()' function that internally restructures the Array Data
        - Not a BAsic Array Function
        - Introduced in ES 6
        - Supported by Browser With Transpilation
    - The flat()  method of array
        - USed to Spread records of array in single 1-D array
            - Array.flat(), the ES 9/10 method
    - If Collection of Objects then make sure that the object's state management in handled by the collection
        - e.g. if the Object is modified the collection MUST receive the modification
        - If object is killed then ite MUST be removed from the collection           
    - Use the Wek References collection to store object references so that when object is modified, it will be reflected into the collection
        - WebSet()
        - WeakMap()     
2. Set the Behavior on Objects /  Collection using the Standard Features offered by JavaScript 
3. Use Functions as Modules and Re-Usable Object to avoid code-repetition  
    -  Define Modules to Scope declarations so that the variable will be available only within the MODULE 
    - Using Functions carefully
        - Make sure that the Function Scope is implemented using the Module
                - var mdl = ((function){.... return {}});
        - While defining instances of function objects or ES 6 classes use the Constrcutor Pattern using Object.create().
            - In JS Object Creational Patterns  
                - use 'new'
                - Object.assign()
                    - New Blank object is created with same schema and data in it        
        - When using nested functions handle the scope of declaration from Outer-to-inner function*** (Closure)
        - Manage the Function object creation and enhancements in it using __proto__ carefully
        - define a common function access across various objects to reduce the code repatation (VERY****)
        - If JS Objects are having identical structure, then we can attach a common functionality to it using 
            - call()
                - This will work on the 'this' scope object of the JS
                - where the Function of external object can be applied directly on the Identical JS object to access their this scope properties
                - Parameters are passed as separate arguments where the JS Function execution COntext will parse these and map with 'this' scope object
                - "Calls a method of an object, substituting another object for the current object."
            - apply()
                - Similar to call
                - PAss One single Array as argument to call so that its records can map with 'this' scope
            - bind()
                - To delegate a new function to an existing object with additional parameters
        - Implement the Overloading of functions carefully with variable number of parameters 
            - It is a mechanism using which JS Parser will decide how invoke a method and execute it based in different types of parameter
                - use the function reference using 'Function()' object of JavaScript
                    - Function() Used for creating a function at runtime
                - use the apply() to create object substitution
                - Dynamic name assignment to a function object    
    - Memoization   
        - An optimize technique that is responsible to improve the performance of processing while execution of computer program.
        - USe Case:
            - If Expensive Function is called frequently by the caller code and the result generation is time consuming processing or expensive process, we 'cache' the result and if the same result is to be returned then it will be directly returned from Cache                    
                - The Recursive Function
    - Think of creating Functions dynamically at runtime instead of writing them during compilation (Parsing-time)
        - The 'Function' Object
            - This is a Standard JS object that accepts function arguments and implementation as input parameter and return result   
            - The Function body with input parameters to the function body is passed as string to the 'Function' object. The JS runtime will parse it as the object and sets its execution context and invoke it for execution      
    - Generators
        - Function returns only a single value (or nothing)
        - in JS we can write a function that can return (aka yield) multiple values one-after-another (like a sequence)
            - Syntax
                - function* mygenerator(){ yield 1; yield 2;yield 3;.... }    
                - e.g. If making a Async call to HTTP API that returns huge data, then to process data and return it in sequence to UI or presenter, create a Generator function               
                    - Sync Generator that iterates over a collection return ir
                    - Async Generator, used in case where the generator function performs async operations   
            - The 'function*' will be internally treated as 'generator' object by JS parser or Runtime. The generator object has the following declarations
                - next(), method to advance generator to next record in sequence
                - value, property to read value at current index
                - done, property that represents that the sequence is over           
4. Use Patterns While writing the Productive code
    - Promise
        - We can call Promises with Promise Chain
            -e.g. Promise.the().then().then.().........catch().finally();
        - Dependency Calls 
            - Subscribe to First Promise Call, Resolve it and then make other dependency promise call...and so.. on    
        - ES 7+ Recommendations
            - Use the async/await mechanism for the sequential or dependency promise execution
            - async is a method modifier which is used is the method is making an 'await'able call      
5. Declare only those object which are useful
